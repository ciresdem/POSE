# CUDEM+IVERT

🤗 Welcome to our CUDEM/IVERT POSE Project

> An Open-Source Framework for Rapid Development and Validation of High-Accuracy Digital Elevation Models

## Highlights

* Funded by the National Science Foundation, this project aims to scope and plan a sustainable Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) around the CUDEM and IVERT software packages.
* The project focuses on drafting a long-term governance framework, expanding documentation, and establishing best practices to support a growing community of users and contributors.
* The team is actively hosting community workshops, virtual meetings, and student training sessions to gather feedback and democratize access to high-accuracy coastal elevation modeling tools.
* By hardening these tools for wider public use, the project directly supports disaster prevention, infrastructure planning, and climate resilience efforts across public and private sectors.
* Our software includes **CUDEM**, a suite of tools for fetching public data, processing point clouds and rasters, gridding via various interpolation algorithms, and transforming datums.
* Our companion software **IVERT** porvides a command-line tool that rapidly validates raster DEMs against NASA’s ICESat-2 photon data by masking and filtering unreliable areas (e.g., water, buildings), performing automatic datum transformations, and generating detailed statistical reports and error maps.

## Get Started

Interested in getting started building your first high-resolution DEM? Here is an example to generate a DEM from high-resolution coastal DEMs of New Orleans:

First, [install the CUDEM software](https://github.com/ciresdem/cudem?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup).

Next, run this `waffles` command (running `waffles —help` will give a brief explainer of what all these command-line options do) and it'll automatically download the datasets needed from the CUDEM fetches module (you can run `fetches --help` to see all supported dataset modules!) of the New Orleans area, and from that data will generate a brand-new DEM at 1/9-arc-second (~3 m) resolution.

```bash
waffles -Rloc:"new orleans" -E.1s -Onola -Mcubic CUDEM
```

This will output a DEM file named 'nola.tif' generated by merging the existing [CUDEM](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-elevation-models) high-resolution coastal models into a single DEM of New Orleans.

If you want to visualize that DEM, use CUDEM's `perspecto` hillshade module to create a color-coded hillshade using the 'wiki-2.0' color palette from CPT-City (as with our other cli tools `perspecto --help` will give a brief description of its options):

```bash
perspecto nola.tif -Cwiki-2.0 -Z0
```
